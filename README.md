## Paperan

> This project is an implementation of design concept Paperan from Designer Patrik Michalicka. The app serves as a small ecommerce app about notebooks. All API data are created from [JSON Generator](https://next.json-generator.com/) and just for illustration purpose.

## Notes on my work

* I am working on responsiveness of the app to different screen sizes, checkout form, authentication, and data persistence on page refresh.

Additional features I added to the app that are not related to the design:

* Filter Sidebar
  * User could filter the products based on type, price range, color, sheet style, cover material and audience.
* Sorting
  * User could sort the products by best sellers, price, most reviews, top-rated and newest.
* Footer
  * This is just a markup with no link connected

## Stack
